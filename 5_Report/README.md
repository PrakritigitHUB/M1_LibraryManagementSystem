# LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

* The Library management System is a project that manages and stores books data electronically ,monitors and controls the transactions in a library. 
* The project Library Management System is developed using C, which mainly focuses on basic operations in a library like :
* adding new books 
* updating new information 
* searching books 
* return books


## BENEFITS

* Saves Time and Cost.
* Secure and Reliable.
* Record Maintenance.
* Increases Efficiency.
* Simple and Easy to Use.


## Strengths

* Simple & Easy to use.
* Increased Library management.
* Highly Secure, Scalable & Reliable. 
* Mobile Access.

## Weakness

* The data stored is prone to cyber attacks like hacking.
* Costly and Expensive.
* Require high-speed internet connectivity.
* Risk of computer virus.


## Opportunities
* The Library Management System can be used outward in spaces which it didn’t inhabit before, such as reading lists repositories, learning systems, research data management,etc.
* Furthermore, it is likely that the future of library systems will consist of a mixture of open and closed systems as well as local and shared services.
* With an increasing advent towards closed platforms like Facebook and proprietary ecosystems, libraries can be used to navigate different platforms and ecosystems.

### Threats
* Libraries send and retrieve data from databases for better management system but some libraries don’t have the right data encryption practices. 
* This can often lead to losing of data and info.
* Sometimes, the data can be easily accessible by the hackers.
