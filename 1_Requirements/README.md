# LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

## INTRODUCTION

* The Library management System is a project that manages and stores books data electronically according to users needs. 
* The project is titled Library Management System for monitoring and controlling the transactions in a library.
* The system helps both users and library managers to keep a constant track of all the books available in the library.
* It allows both the admin and the student to search for the desired book.
* The project Library Management System is developed using C, which mainly focuses on basic operations in a library like adding new books, updating new information, searching books and return books.
* This LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM gives us the complete information about the library. 
* We can enter the record of new books and retrieve the details of books available in the library.
* We can issue the books to the students and maintain their records and can also check how many books are issued and stock available in the library. 
* We can maintain late fine feature for students who returns the issued books after the due date.

## OBJECTIVES

a) To build a system that can receive input and generate output automatically in an easy way and short time.
b) To build a management system that is able to monitor and manage all library operations efficiently.
c) Give an opportunity to librarians to reduce mistakes which happen during manual handling.
d) To maintain security.
e) To enter and preserve details of the various issues and keep a track on their returns.

## BENEFITS:

a) Saves Time and Cost.
b) Secure and Reliable.
c) Record Maintenance.
d) Increases Efficiency.
e) Simple and Easy to Use.

## 4W'S and 1H

### Who
This Library Management System is an application which can be used by all the students,staff and any other person who is having ID's.

### What
Library Management Systems is software that helps to maintain a database that is useful to enter new books & keep records of books borrowed by the users, with the respective submission dates.

### When
This Library Management System is very useful when large no. of readers visit library to return, renewal, or issue books. It is a very tedious process to enter the records manually.Hence,this project becomes useful.

### Where
The Library management system is nowadays essential for schools, colleges, private libraries, and many other organizations. They can use this software as the purpose of issuing books,returning books or for renewal of issue.

### How
This project is implemented for issuing books, retunrning on time, or renewal purpose by entering the user's id as input.

## Swot Analysis

### Strengths

a) Simple & Easy to use.
b) Increased Library management.
c) Highly Secure, Scalable & Reliable. 
d) Mobile Access.

### Weakness

a) The data stored is prone to cyber attacks like hacking.
b) Costly and Expensive.
c) Require high-speed internet connectivity.
d) Risk of computer virus.

## Opportunities
* The Library Management System can be used outward in spaces which it didn’t inhabit before, such as reading lists repositories, learning systems, research data management,etc.
* Furthermore, it is likely that the future of library systems will consist of a mixture of open and closed systems as well as local and shared services.
* With an increasing advent towards closed platforms like Facebook and proprietary ecosystems, libraries can be used to navigate different platforms and ecosystems.

### Threats
* Libraries send and retrieve data from databases for better management system but some libraries don’t have the right data encryption practices. 
* This can often lead to losing of data and info.
* Sometimes, the data can be easily accessible by the hackers.
